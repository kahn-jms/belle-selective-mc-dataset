# SmartBKG dataset

The goal of this classification problem is to identify generated events that pass a selection already before the expensive detector simulation and reconstruction.

The dataset contains simulated <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y(4S)\rightarrow B^0 \bar{B}^0"> events with generator level information. The label indicates if the event passes (1) or fails (0) a selection that was applied after detector simulation and reconstruction. The selection applies event level cuts and some criteria on candidates from reconstructed hadronic <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B^0"> decays.

The dataset is explained in more detail, including a demonstration with a reference model, in [example.ipynb](example.ipynb)
