# Bias quantification

Included in the dataset are event-level kinematic variables which describe the whole graph. These variables are derived from  reconstructed particles and can't be used as network input. However they can (should) be used during training as bias observables.

To quantify biases we are using the KL divergence between all true and true positive events. True events are labeled in the dataset. True positive events are true events which have also been classified as true events by the network.

To provide accurate data for specialized WGs to use in physics analysis, we want to keep the KL divergence below a certain value across all bias observables. This restriction combined with the highest speedup describes the performance of a certain model.

## KL divergence

To evaluate the bias overall, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the expected (true events) and resulting distributions (positive) for decorrelation variables. Since there is still a selection after reconstruction, we can only use true positive events.

Kullback-Leibler divergence of Q from P: $D_{KL}(P\|Q)=-\sum_{x\in\chi}{P(x)log\left(\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)}\right)}$

The KL divergence should be below $KL_{div}<0.0015$. This value may change for different WGs depending on the results.
